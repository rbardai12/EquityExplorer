# EquityExplorer

# Information
EquityExplorer is a tool that uses the Anaplan database, APIs, and Python to create an EOD ticker price check. The program will run a lot of tickers at EOD, and it will generate all the data into an Anaplan database. By using APIs, the data is retreived, and then it is processed into the Anaplan database using bash scripts. The Anaplan database will then show users a visual representation of what stock is a good purchase base. Users can make their own calculation based on the three sheets given per stock: Balance, Income, and Expense sheets.
